# Part 3: Introduction To Finite State Machine And User Registration

Welcome to Part 3 of the A2SV Remote Second Year Telegram Bot Development Phase! In this section, we'll delve into FSM in telegram bot using aiogram library. To get a hands on experience you will be registering your user's information while saving the data on temporary storage.

## Getting Started

To begin this exercise, follow these detailed steps (If you haven't done them already):

1. **Clone the Repository / Open the github Codespace:**
   - Use GitHub Codespace for a consistent development environment.
   - Or Clone the repository to your local 

2. **Create Your Branch:**
   - Ensure platform consistency by creating a new branch with the format `[First_Name].[Task].3`.
   - **Task:** Run the command `git checkout -b YourName.Task.3` to create your branch.

3. **Copy Task Folder:**
   - Your submission should be inside the Part_3 directory and it should be within a directory called [Your_first_name]
   - **Task:** After finishing your task, make sure to add a readme and add your deployed bot name to it.

## Task Overview

### 1. Introduction To Finite State Machine And User Registration
   - Learn about the concept of FSM and storage for building your Telegram bot project.
   - **Task:** Read the following [learning material](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rNLezvd9qdtNWERGYArIHDVwN-ey5knFJ477jn3kOwM/edit?usp=sharing).

### 2. Create a telegram bot that registers users and store their data on temporary storage:
   - Use BotFather to create your third Telegram bot. Then ubild register command and form.
   - **Task:** - Build a telegram bot that registers users and store their data on temporary storage then returns their data at the end.
               - Add one or more features that make use of FSM and storage as well
### 3. Host on PythonAnywhere

   - Use the tutorial below to understand how you can host your bot on PythonAnywhere
   - **Task:** Copy all your files and folders within folder to pythonanywhere folder and then run it. Don't forget putting your deployed bot in the readme file within your solution directory.

     **Note:**  Make sure to kill the consoles of your part_1 task since python anywhere only gives you 2 consoles at a time
### 4. Send a Pull Request
   - Once tasks are completed, send a pull request with your changes.
   - If your solution is accepted, it will be merged, and you can move on to the next task.

Happy coding!
